            <p>
                Futbolín is a personal pet project of <a href="https://maarten.mulders.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maarten Mulders</a> or "I" / "me".
                This privacy policy will explain how I use the personal data I collect from you when you use this website.
                It is based on the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template</a> provided by Proton Technologies AG.

            <h2>What data do I collect?</h2>
            <p>
                I collect the following <strong>personal identification information</strong>:

                    Your email address as you have supplied to Google.
                    This allows Futbolín to send you notifications via email.
                </dd>

                <dt class="col-3">Name</dt>
                <dd class="col-9">

            <h2>How do I store your data?</h2>
            <p>
                The information I collect is stored "in memory".
