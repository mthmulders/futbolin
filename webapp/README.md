# Web Application

This module contains the user-facing web application for Futbol√≠n.

## Configuration

Configuration follows a two-step approach.
Settings can be changed in a configuration file that is packaged with the application.
This is a good place for "sane defaults".
You can override some settings using environment variables.

This are the supported configuration settings.
